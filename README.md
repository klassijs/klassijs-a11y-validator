The function aims to ensure a more inclusive user experience, especially for individuals with disabilities, by identifying and helping resolve accessibility issues.

## Key Features:

- **Automated Accessibility Testing**: Quickly validates the accessibility of web pages and applications.
- **Compliance Checks**: Ensures your application meets WCAG 2.0/2.1 guidelines and other accessibility standards.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides detailed reports on accessibility issues found during validation.
- **Customizable Rules**: Customize which accessibility rules you want to check based on your project's needs.
- **Integration Ready**: Easily integrate into your CI/CD pipelines for continuous accessibility validation.

## Installation

You can easily install the **a11y-validator** using **pnpm**. Follow the steps below:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a guide on how to use the **a11y-validator** to check the accessibility of a webpage or application:

1. **Import the Tool**:
   Import the `a11y-validator` module into your project:
   ```javascript
   const { a11yValidator } = require('klassijs-a11y-validator');
   ```

2. **Run Accessibility Validation**:
   Use the `validate` method to check a URL or HTML file for accessibility issues:
   ```javascript
   async function runA11yValidation() {
       try {
           const results = await a11yValidator('https://yourwebsite.com');
           console.log('Accessibility Validation Results:', results);
       } catch (error) {
           console.error('Error during accessibility validation:', error);
       }
   }

   runA11yValidation();
   ```

   The `validate` method will return a detailed report containing any accessibility issues, such as missing alt text, color contrast problems, and other violations of accessibility guidelines.

3. **Review the Report**:
   The results will typically contain details such as:
    - The issue description

    - The location of the issue (e.g., the affected element)
    - Recommended fixes or actions
