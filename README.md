# Accessibility Verification Test Service

## Overview

This function is designed to automate the **verification of accessibility compliance** for digital content, such as websites or applications, by programmatically testing elements against established accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.0,2.1,2.2 on level A, AA and AAA). The function aims to ensure a more inclusive user experience, especially for individuals with disabilities, by identifying and helping resolve accessibility issues.

#### Key Features:

1. **Automated Checks**: The function uses a combination of automated accessibility checks to quickly identify common barriers, such as missing alt attributes, color contrast issues, keyboard navigation errors, and improper ARIA roles. It leverages best practices and standards, providing fast initial feedback on compliance.

2. **Manual Accessibility Enhancements**: If manual testing is supported, the function could allow testers to integrate more complex accessibility checks—such as screen reader compatibility or logical tab order—into the workflow, thereby covering more intricate issues that automated tools may miss.

3. **Compliance Reporting**: The function generates an accessibility report detailing each issue identified, explaining its potential impact on users, and recommending steps for remediation. This report supports developers in prioritizing and addressing issues in alignment with accessibility standards.

4. **Scalable and Flexible**: The function is designed to be used within various development environments and can integrate with CI/CD pipelines, enabling continuous accessibility testing throughout the development lifecycle.

5. **Improves Usability for All Users**: By ensuring compliance with accessibility standards, the function enhances the overall usability of digital content, benefiting not only individuals with disabilities but also users on different devices or with temporary accessibility needs.

6. **Reporting**: The function can generate detailed reports on accessibility issues, including their severity, location, and recommended fixes. These reports can be shared with development teams, stakeholders, or clients to track progress and ensure compliance.

7. **Educational Resource**: The function can serve as an educational tool for developers, designers, and content creators, helping them understand accessibility requirements and best practices to create more inclusive digital experiences.
